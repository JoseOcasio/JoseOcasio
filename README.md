Hey there, I'm Jose Ocasio.

I was borned and raised in Puerto Rico in a small town on the east side. Growing up I was always passionate about technology and one day I just decided to become a computer engineer. 
I graduated from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.


## Interests
I'm currently learning a bunch of things and tinkering with new tech. I have a full time job where I function as a Software Architect and Software Engineer.
There is a lot I don't know, which pushes me to learn a bit more everyday. 

Currently, I'm interested in
* Cloud Architecture
* Cloud Native Solutions
* ReactJS
* Software Development and Engineering
* System Design
* Observability
* Everything as Code strategies
* Game Development

## Books recently finished
* Clean Code
